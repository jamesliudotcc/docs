# Stop trying to make me a morning person

Some people are morning people, some people are not. Call them larks and owls. Stop trying to make
owls into larks. [It is bad for their mental health](https://scitechdaily.com/defying-your-natural-body-clock-linked-to-depression-and-lower-wellbeing/).

The research has shown that being a morning person is good for your mental health. So the advice
was to become a morning person. But as this article points out, your sleep cycle is genetic. It's 
the being forced to be out of sync that is bad!

When I was a barista, I didn't like clopens. But what was even worse was a week of opens in a row.
What I really minded was opens. Working the graveyard shift wasn't so bad, actually, compared to
opening.

Society is set up for larks. It is an especially big advantage in the west coast in the US, where
you can sync up with work colleages, counterparties, the NYSE market open, if you are a lark. But
if the pandemic work from home scheduling has shown anything, it is that we don't all need to be at
work at the same time.
