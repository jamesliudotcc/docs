# Serge Lang's A First Courst in Calculus

This book is available new from Springer as _Short Calculus_, a reprint of the first edition, and _A First Course in Calculus_, which is a reprint of the fifth edition. I read through a used copy of the second edition, an Addison Wesley hardcover. It is slightly expanded from the first edition, but still ends at page 292, not counting appendices.

## The basic thesis of the book

Lang gives the rationale for the book in the Foreward. The basic gist is:

1. A first course in Calculus should not dwell on limits before showing how they are used in derivatives and integrals. Thus, they go in an appendix.
2. Use geometric intuition to introduce trigonometry and integrals.
3. Proofs should be introduced gently, with plenty of opportunity to practice.
4. A great deal of analytic geometry of conic sections can be left out.
5. Most calculus books are too long at 500-600 pages.

And as a kind of lagniappe, that calculus can be taught to 15 year olds.

## Why read this book

For myself, I wanted to brush up two decades after taking calculus in high school. It worked wonderfully for the purpose. I did many of the exercises (maybe about a quarter) including some of the proofs.

Actually, most of the rationales are about right in my estimation. To my horror, I have seen precalc books with limits as a topic. I guess AP requires limits for calculus, but I spent all of that year wondering why it really mattered. Just use your geometric intuition and the formulas, and you can do the problems. The treatment of limits I got felt rote and cargo-culty. It took until I glanced inside Spivak's _Calculus_ that I discovered that limits went **deep**, and that I wasn't ready for them. Lang has this dead to rights when he writes, "For some reason, it has become fashionable to hold that the best place to enter the subject is between numbers and limits. Experience shows taht students do _not_ have the proper psychological background to accept this, and resit it tremendously." At least Spivak is honest about this too, and enters the subject at numbers.

The ramp up  to writing proofs is superb in the first half of the book. Some early proof writing is literally rewriting the proofs he wrote with some signs reversed. They get progressively harder as the book goes on.

Also, the author's voice is warm and inviting throughout. He writes as if he is there to help you out. It reminds me of Daniel Friedman's _The Little ..._ books. Hard material, soft authorial voice. Without any of the other advantages of this book, it is enough to recommend it as a replacement for modern calculus textbooks, which are sterile and rote by comparison.

## Why not read this book

Being from 1968, the second edition is from before modern computers (including hand calculators). Many exercises ask for calculations that should really be left to machines. Manual graph drawing recieves a whole chapter, which seems especially quaint. The space could have been better used to be more descriptive in the proofs that are provided. By the same ligths, is a whole chapter on Taylor's Formula really needed today (though, modern textbooks also have it)?

The book also ramps up in difficulty quite a bit in the last quarter or so. There seems to be a step change in difficulty at Chapter XII, "Some Substantial Exercises." A more gradual transition around there would have been a better use of the space and effort.

There are also whole chapters on trigonometry and logarithms/exponents, which are now covered in precalc. You may suspect that they are redundant, but this is really the first time I really felt like I understood either.

You may find four-color printing useful for learning. You may find a wraparound photograph on the cover attractive. Or you may find putting a thousand page textbook useful in impressing others, or good ballast for rucking up hills. Then you want a modern textbook instead.

## Where this book fits

For self study, I think it is superior to the big textbooks like Stewart. There are plenty of answer in the back, and plenty more can be had from using a calculator. The computation exercises can be checked using a good scientific calculator. Graphs can be done using a graphing calculator or Wolfram Alpha, even the free version. Basically everything except the proofs can be checked using Wolfram Alpha.

There are enough proofs so that you can use it as a ramp to get to an "advanced calculus" textbook like Spivak. Whether you consider Spivak's book as "advanved calculus" or "analysis" will be left as an exercise for the reader.

## Conclusion

I can't speak for the most recent edition, which is much longer than even the 500 pages Lang considers too long. The first edition, which has even fewer exercises, should be fine as well. I hear that edition comes without answers. But if you need to check your work, a computer can tell you most of the answers. As for the proof exercises, the second edition does not provide them either. That said, Springer tends to feature such poor printing and binding that you are probably better served finding a used hardcover: the paper is a gentle ivory, the printing is nice sharp lithography, and the binding is sewn.

I am glad I read it. I feel much better prepared for Spivak after reading this. Honestly, I would have been better prepared for Spivak if I had been taught my first year of calculus from this book instead of a modern textbook. Lang is right about where to start with a calculus book. Limits can be hand-waved in a first course. If you are not constrained by AP requirements, this is a better intro calculus book than any modern textbook.
