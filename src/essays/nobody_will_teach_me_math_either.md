# Nobody Will Teach me Math Either

[Here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30302079) is an interesting [article](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/02/stem-intro-courses-humanites-exploration) about math teaching.

Some people did not read the article very carefully before commenting or voting. The author was through linear algebra before college, hardly a math novice. That was the course they took, MAT202, Linear Algebra with Applications. Hardly someone out of their league for the course. Scroll down in the comments, and you'll see that it is a classic weed-out class. It's not supposed to help you learn. Sigh.

Listen. I hear you, friend.

So it seems that in colleges, there are three kinds of math classes. The ones for math majors (physics majors too, and I guess if you want to go to Harvard for econ PhD school, you should also take these), the ones for science and engineering majors, and math for poets. Math for majors goes like this: Honors Calculus (forget that you already did AP calc, or even beyond it) -> Analysis -> Algebra -> Yet harder things. Math for non-majors goes like this: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations (often a sequence called "Applied Math"). Math for non-majors, I don't know. At the University of Chicago, the [blank] for non-majors courses were beautiful and if I could go again, I would take all of those, the core, the "Big Problems" capstone classes, and nothing else. (Apparently, you can get a job by going to a coding boot camp. Or law school.)

I think that the gatekeeping classes are there mostly for the sake of keeping people out, and that is because the colleges can't hire enough faculty in the subjects that the students want to take. That in turn is because other departments refuse to let them. (There is a Jill Lepore article on the New Yorker on CS50 about this, from the other departments' point of view. I won't link to it).

I think what the author is looking for is "Math for poets who can get through linear algebra before college." Me too! That's exactly what I want. Or rather, I want that class to ladder up to deep learning and quantum mechanics and non-linear dynamics for poets who can get through math for poets who can get through linear algebra before college. Taught by teachers who care that I'm learning, and will help me when I'm stuck.

But that class can't exist for the same reason they can't give out the answers to the homeworks. People would find their way through the filter using that class, especially if it was online.

Too bad.
