# Twelve Rules for Law School

## 1. Don't go to law school

## 2. You are in law school to win. Be a gunner.

## 3. Know if you want essays or final exams

## 4. Don't take too many essay classes at once

## 5. Get your internships right away, before you are ready

## 6. You don't need up-to-date editions of casebooks

## 7. Sleep

## 8. Do less

Nobody cares if you are a notes editor. Heck, nobody really cares if you are an articles editor either. Maybe some judges care for clerkship hiring if you are editor in chief of the Yalvard Law Review, but that is about it. So don't run for office in law review.

Nobody cares if you are president of some club either. Do it if you are really passionate about something. Being passionate about something, that is useful in an interview. Being 
president of a club that gives you an excuse to put it on your resume. Then people might 
ask you about it.

But don't put cyclocross on your resume. I did get asked about it at an interview. The lawyer's husband did cyclocross. But lawyers in big law firms don't do cyclocross. They sit in a chair and do law. So I didn't get the job.

## 9. Save the hard classes for 3L

## 10.
