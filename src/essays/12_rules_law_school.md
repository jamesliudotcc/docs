# Twelve Rules for Law School

## 1. Don't go to law school

## 2. Don't pay for law school

## 3. You play to win the game. Be a gunner

## 4. Do less

Nobody cares if you are a notes editor. Heck, nobody really cares if you are an articles editor either. Maybe some judges care for clerkship hiring if you are editor in chief of the Yalvard Law Review, but that is about it. So don't run for office in law review.

Nobody cares if you are president of some club either. Do it if you are really passionate about something. Being passionate about something, that is useful in an interview. Being president of a club that gives you an excuse to put it on your resume. Then people might ask you about it.

But don't put cyclocross on your resume. I did get asked about it at an interview. The lawyer's husband did cyclocross. But lawyers in big law firms don't practice cyclocross. They sit in a chair and practice law. So I didn't get the job.

## 5. Know if you want essays or final exams

## 6. Don't take too many essay classes at once

## 7. Take more doctrinal classes

It comes in handy to know about trusts and estates, and family law, and whatever, when it is time for the bar exam. you went to law school after all, not policy school. If you had wanted to do policy, you should have gone to policy school. See above.

## 8. Get your internships right away, before you are ready

## 9. You don't need up-to-date editions of casebooks

## 10. Sleep

## 11. Save the hard classes for 3L

## 12.
