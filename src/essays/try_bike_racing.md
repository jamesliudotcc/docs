# 95th percentile is as hard as the thing

Dan Luu suggests that being p-95 good at stuff is [not that hard](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/) based on the fact that in his experience, the quantifiable things he does, p-95 people make a lot of easily correctable mistakes.

Dan should try some different things, like bike racing. Bike racing, the kind where you register for races and you get a rank-ordered-result of where you finished in the race (or worse, a DNF, or worse yet, a DNS). Totally quantifiable. I did bike racing for a few years, and let me tell you. I was nowhere near the top 95%.

And I did a bunch of things aimed at improving. I went to a pro clinic (a pro gave the clinic, making a pro clinic). I went to organized practices several times a week. I did invividual or small group practices on the days the organized practices were not happening. Did I get better? Of course I did. As for correcting obvious errors, yes, I made plenty of obvious errors during races, but you try correcting those when your heart rate is 195 bpm. So you try to fix the mistakes in practice and hope you do the right thing in the race.

Could I have done better? Sure. I could have done fewer other things for fun. I could have done intervals more often (though there were intervals). But these weren't going to propel me into the 95 percentile. Other amateur racers were working as hard or harder than I was, and plenty of people have better VO2 max than I do.
