# Explaining the Cloud to my Wife

My wife and I were both reading Thomas Friedman's book _Thanks for Being Late_, which is in large part about what he calls "the cloud slash the supernova."

I have a more silicon wafers view of the cloud than Friedman. Honestly, I think that what he attributes to the cloud is more attributable to the ubiquity of compute, which the cloud only slightly accelerates.

## The cloud means renting instead of owning

That's it. The cloud is just renting computers instead of owning them. And the economics are remarkably similar to renting or owning your home: if you own it, you have to deal with repairs yourself. If you are living in the wrong house, it is easier to move when you rent. There are some differences, and those differences are what you'd expect from the differences between humans and computers.

1. Computers don't wither away without sunlight the outdoors.
2. It is much more valuable for computers to be near each other for networking connections.
3. There is much less sentimental value for owning your computer instead of renting it, compared to a "home".
4. Computers die the way video game avatars die. You just add more coins for more lives.
5. You pay rent by the second. Of course, there are discounts for committing to a year up front.

So it is much more advantageous to rent than buy, as compared to home ownership. Then there is the difference between capital expenditure and operational expenditure (capex and opex). Companies strongly prefer opex to capex for accounting and tax reasons, so that is another advantage of home ownership that does not apply to computer ownership. Also, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google can amortize the cost of a computer much cheaper than you can. Even given a profit margin for them, it can still be cheaper to rent from a cloud vendor than borrowing money--or worse, raising equity funding--to buy the computer.

What it adds up to is that you can afford to get more compute by renting than buying. The cost of compute is still going down in the medium term, but the advantage of taking care of your compute needs by renting instead of buying means that you pay can the lower price today instead of having to wait.

And that's the cloud.

Which is why Friedman is wrong by calling it the cloud slash the supernova. I think Friedman is conflating two concepts: renting computers by the second--the cloud--and ubiquitous compute--the supernova.
