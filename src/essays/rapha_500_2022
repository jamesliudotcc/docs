# 2022 Rapha 500

The hardest days on a bike are the ones you don't finish. Mine was the time I went to the Ten Thousand in 2018, got dropped, and eventually got picked up by another team's van. That was, in retrospect, me telling myself that I was just going to send it (and falling flat on my face as a result). That year, almost nobody finished because of the 95 degree heat. But even without that, I wouldn't have finished. If anything, the heat meant that every team sent their vans to pick up riders, and so I found an easy way out.

So don't plan to just send it. The Rapha 500 is one of those things you just can't send. 500 kilometers in 8 days is doable, but only with some planning, and only with relentless execution against that plan.

## The plan

This year, my wife and kid went to the midwest for Christmas, and I did not. This left all the holidays free, and so the plan was to put in the big miles on my off days, and put big enough rides on the days between. Being in Seattle, I'd have to find ways to go easy on the climbs. 500 km in 8 days means 62.5 km a day, or about 38 miles. There were 4 off days, 4 work days.

Oh, and the rain. The forecast was for rain every day. But knowing Seattle, I knew that there would be periods of no rain, and for the most part, it would be easy, gentle rain.

## The riding

The week before, I put up a ride around Lake Washington for 55 miles. Just to make sure my body was ready for some long riding. If it was too much, I would have known. Anyway, the week of recovery would have put me in a position to do the long rides I needed. The plan was to do it Saturday, and have some easy miles Sunday. Instead, I slipped on some ice on Saturday, so that was the ride for the day. I did the long ride Sunday on my slower, suerer, commuter bike.

The day before was freezing rain. I woke up to the whole neighborhood covered with ice. I even cleared a path to the grocery store. It was not a good sign.

Day 1, I put in what should have been easy miles going to an appointment. The rain was cold and hard, so it wasn't exactly easy. When the rain started letting up, I went for it. It was honestly pretty miserable for the first hour or so, but the rain kept getting lighter, until I was mostly dry by the time I came home. Even though it was dark by then, and the rain had started up again. So much for getting back dry. But now I was a little bit ahead of 38 miles a day. It was enough to keep going on.

Day 2, I put up 70 miles. I started later than I should have, but once I was around Lake Sammamisih, I was committed. At some point, I caught a rider who wanted to do 18 around on the flats. Of course I had chased, who do you think I am? I couldn't keep up, so I let them go.

Day 3, I picked another spot on the map and went for it. Near the end, I saw a sign that said 9% descent, and I decided I was in no mood to climb my way back up from it, so I turned back. I should not have chosen a route away from the lakes. Some of it was on rails-to-trails, but not all of it. I could have gotten the miles without the climbs. Yes, I like climbing. But I needed to guard my strength. When the rain came, it was sharp and cold. I was glad to only catch maybe a half hour of it.

Day 4, I paid for day 3. There was a wind storm and mostly I stayed in to avoid it. But I did need to get a bag of coffee, so there was a short ride. I needed all the miles I could get, but even then it was not really enough. Honestly, I needed the rest more than the miles. But days 5 & 6, & 7 would need to be big days. Day 8 might need another 70 mile day around all the lakes.

Day 5, it was sunny. I rode the road bike. I caught some bonus miles by the ocean, but with some climbing I didn't need. I put in 32 miles. Things would depend on day 6.

Day 6, I did slightly less. But now my legs felt better. It had rained all morning, and more was on the way, so I rode the commute bike. Things felt free and easy. You know how some riders say it is easier on week 3 of a grand tour? If you look at the numbers, they are much weaker riders than they were on week one. If you look at the numbers, I was not riding well. But anyway, I put up 27 miles, and I felt good. 85 miles to go in 2 days. Lots of options to get all the way to the end.
