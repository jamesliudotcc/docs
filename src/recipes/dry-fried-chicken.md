# Dry Fried Chicken

This is an adaptation of Fuschia Dunlop's The Food of Sichuan. The recipe is on page 186. You should buy the book.

The adaptation is for use with a 10" skillet. I reduced the recipe for a single meal for one person. If you are sharing, cook some more dishes and make your guests (family?) feel special. It is too much meat for one meal anyway. Feel free to double this if recipe if you have a 12" skillet handy. If you try to double this on a 10", you will crowd the food. If liquid pools in the bottom of your pan, it is probably too late. Anyway, if so, pour everything off using a sieve (save the liquid to degalze the pan later for sauce), heat the pan up until it is blazing hot, add a little more oil, and keep going with the dry ingredients. Maybe that will rescue the dish, maybe not.



> As an aside, here is how to read the recipes. The ingredients are bulleted, with prep instructions. Do this ahead of time for your mise-en-place. If you are fast, you can get away with doing some of the prep while the food is working on the stove. The percent is what I use on my Cooktek 1800 W, but are roughly what you'd think if you translate to low, medium, high. Every stove is different. Unless they are Cookteks of the same watt rating, in which case I assume they are pretty similar. I assume you know when to add salt and how much. I assume you know how to start a pan for sauteing with oil.

- 1 chicken thigh, with skin, deboned, cut into 1/2" pieces.
Saute at 60%, with the skin-side down (as much as possible) until golden brown delicious on that side.
- Sichuan chili pepper, chopped about as long as they are wide, to taste
- Sichuan peppercorns, to taste
Add to sauteing chicken. Turn a few times to distribute everything, until fragrant
- Chili bean paste, to taste
Turn down the heat and stir in, being careful not to burn the sauce.
- 1 clove garlic, sliced thin
- about that much ginger, similar
- 3 scallions, white parts only, finely chopped
Add, turn heat back up and stir fry until fragrant
- Dark soy sauce, just a touch
- 1 green bell pepper, or other pepper, cut to about 1" by 1/2" pieces
Add, and stir fry until the peppers are sufficiently cooked.
- Chili oil
Finish with chili oil, to taste.
