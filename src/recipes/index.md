> As an aside, here is how to read the recipes. The ingredients are bulleted, with prep instructions. Do this ahead of time for your mise-en-place. If you are fast, you can get away with doing some of the prep while the food is working on the stove. The percent is what I use on my Cooktek 1800 W, but are roughly what you'd think if you translate to low, medium, high. Every stove is different. Unless they are Cookteks of the same watt rating, in which case I assume they are pretty similar. I assume you know when to add salt and how much. I assume you know how to start a pan for sauteing with oil.
