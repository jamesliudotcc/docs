### TLDR

A working group is not a team. A team has these characteristics:

1. A common purpose
2. Specific performance goals stemming from the common purpose
3. A mix of complementary skills
4. A strong commitment to how the work gets done
5. Mutual Accountability

A team plays to win. So, from that, it follows:

- Figure out what winning looks like
- First impressions matter
- Get some early wins
- Spend time together
- Cheer each other on

Maybe a working group is a better for a task than a team:

> Many groups that run things can be more effective as working groups than as teams. The key judgment is whether the sum of individual bests will suffice for the performance challenge at hand or whether the group must deliver substantial incremental performance requiring real joint work products.
