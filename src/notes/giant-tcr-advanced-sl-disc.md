# The Giant TCR Advanced SL Disc

This is not really a review of a particular bike, but more of a record of my thought
process in how I came to own this particular bike.

You should probably just buy a gravel bike, in whatever trim you can afford, and this
being 2021, in whatever brand is in stock where you happen to be.

First, what is it? It's a road bike. Road bikes have, for some time now, come in three
subcategories: aero, in-between, and comfort. All of the larger manufacturers have all
three kinds. The in-between category is often also the lightest weight bike, because it
is subject to fewer engineering constraints imposed by the other two categories.

The categories blend, somewhat. Specialized stopped producing their aero category bike,
the Venge, when the all-around bike became close enough in aero performance, but then
introduced a new bike, the Aethos, to fill the space that the Tarmac had vacated. Trek
had done the same thing by introducing the Domane when the Madone became so aero that
it displaced the former aero bike in the range.

The TCR is Giant's in-between bike. Advanced means that it is made with carbon fiber
(Giant calls this composite, which is probably more accurate) instead of aluminum. SL
means that it has an integrated seat post. SL also probably stands for super-light,
but as with all acronyms these days, mostly just stands for itself.

## The Thought Process

One of my coworkers owns a Dodge Viper, which is his every-day driver. This being
Seattle, he mostly commutes on a bus. One day, we had an off site, and of course he
drove the Viper. The lesson was, live your best life.

It was also time to retire my Specialized Crux, since I wasn't racing it any more,
and had gone through plenty. There were a bunch of misalignments as a result of some
crashes along the way, but hey, it was a cyclocross bike, cyclocross bikes go through
a lot.

So what next? I bought a used Look 765, a comfort road bike, and it was fine, except
I couldn't get the bars low enough (this is a thing with comfort bikes) for my comfort,
and the bottom bracket makes a clicking sound.

I kept a record of the stack and reach numbers of a bunch of candidates. Basically, it
came down to the TCR a 3T Exploro. I know, totally different use cases. But they had the
right stack and reach numbers, and that is what really matters.

Ok, so fit is number one. Next, I wanted a:
