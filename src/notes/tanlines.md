# Tanlines

I found myself making a goal that I would get myself some really crisp
tanlines this summer. It's a cyclist thing, and it is almost certainly
an unhealthy obsession. It means that all (or most) of your outdoor activities
are in a single sport, and moreover you wear the exact same set of clothes
for those activities.

And, you can't even really show it off! If go out in skimpier clothes,
you will lose the crisp edge on the tanlines. And everyone who isn't
a cyclist would think you had some kind of skin condition. All you can
do is kind of discreetly peel under the sleeve of your jersey to other
cyclists and proclaim, "check this out," to some murmurs of agreement.
