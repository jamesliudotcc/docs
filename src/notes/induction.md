# Induction Cooktops

Induction really is better. And it is not true that you can't get [wok hei](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiIgc6hk6nyAhUEu54KHaZ1AvsQFnoECAUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fscience%2Farchive%2F2020%2F10%2Fgas-stoves-are-bad-you-and-environment%2F616700%2F&usg=AOvVaw3MrSxJy9aNblzD2U9n-mv0) with an induction cooktop. You can't do it with a regular wok on a flat cooktop. But there are flat "saute" pans that have most of the virtues of a wok, and which does buy you wok hei, or you can get rounded induction fobs.

Woks on normal gas stoves are a disaster at any event. Look at the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant. Each wok sits atop its own "rocket stove" which blasts a whole bunch more fire at the bottom of a wok than even the largest fob on a home Viking. You get closer with a deep saute pan with flared sides on an induction cooktop than you do with a wok on a gas stovetop.
